ummary: What's Left for V1
Core gaps blocking a functional v1:

Seed Data – Database is empty. Need ~5-10 test problems in a Linear Algebra course
Auth UI – Login/signup forms exist but aren't wired to the backend API
Courses List – No page to browse and enroll in courses
Progress Display – Dashboard doesn't show real user learning metrics
Error Handling – Missing toast notifications and proper error display
Form Validation – No client-side validation or feedback
Mobile Responsiveness – Desktop-only currently
Submission Feedback – Basic grading, needs better explanations
Estimated effort: 14-19 hours (2-3 days to full v1 release)

Quick wins to start:

Create seed data script (30 min)
Wire auth forms (1 hour)
Build courses listing page (1-2 hours)
Add toast notifications (1 hour)
Want me to start implementing these? I'd recommend starting with seed data + auth UI wiring to get a working signup/login flow, then courses page.
